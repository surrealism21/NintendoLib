# NintendoLib - nintendo's shit ass libraries

This is intended to be used as a library for **devkitPro** games. It uses Makefile to compile and may be kind of a mess in the source directories, I'll clean that up... eventually.
There is a __lot__ of content here! (when this is done) so use it! Please! Or I will ***Tingly***

## Contains: (All WIP at this time)

- NW4R (nintendo ware for revolution)

This is a 2D and 3D middleware library

- EGG

Prices on these kinds of libraries are going up due to avian flu (I have not a clue what this does, but it's a Nintendo only thing)

- RVL (revolution) SDK

This handles file formats like ARC. Without it, you won't have the files that build up NW4R projects.

I will make no attempt to decompile MSL_C as it's with CodeWarrior. (CW for MPC55xx and MPC56xx 2.10\PowerPC_EABI_Support\MSL)

3rd party credits:
some symbols i used to start with from nsmbw decomp people
all of the code i decompiled is from New Super Mario Bros Wii PAL revision 1
